Between 2020 and 2023, a total of 2740 fires were recorded across the UK (Figure 1). The average **Fire Radiative Power** was 18.6 MW. The FRP values ranged from a minimum of 2.3 MW to a maximum of 592.7 MW. Notably, 75% of the fires had a FRP below 17.9 MW, indicating the predominance of lower-intensity fires in the dataset with a few exceptionally high FRP values (Figure 2).

Fires occurred in 26 of the 36 **land cover** types present in the UK (Figure 3). The land cover category with the highest number of fire occurrences was 'Industrial or commercial units' while the categories with the fewest fires were 'Construction sites', 'Port areas', 'Fruit trees and berry plantations', 'Salt marshes' and 'Complex cultivation patterns'. Land covers with no fire occurrences were excluded from the study.

The average **elevation** of fire locations was 125.8m, with most fires occurring below 200m. The **annual average temperature** at fire locations was 10.1°C, with little variation across the UK. As expected, southern regions showed higher annual average temperatures than the north. **Annual total precipitation** averaged 1178mm, with higher rainfall observed along the western coastline. **Annual average wind speed** showed little variation across the UK and averaged at 23 km/h (Figure 4).
